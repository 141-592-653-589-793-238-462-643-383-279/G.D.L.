# AlgoLang

## Description

AlgoLang is a language generated by a program provisionally named LG (LanguageGenerator).

This language generator is coded in Python and, for the moment, uses three lists. A list of adjectives, a list of verbs and a list of nouns. These lists can be accessed from the “Dictionaries” file in “Project”.

The program's operation is fairly straightforward. For each word, it generates another word based on specific criteria defined upstream in the code, as automatically as possible.
