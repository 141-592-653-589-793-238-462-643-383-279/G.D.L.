# AlgoLang Project

AlgoLang is a language generator developed in Python that automatically creates words based on a predefined list of frequently used French words. The project uses a program provisionally named LangMake to generate corresponding words with minimal manual input.

## Overview

The goal of AlgoLang is to take each word from a French word list and generate a new word using an algorithm that follows specific rules. The generated words are then saved, paired with their French counterparts, into an output file.

Current version: **v1.3.11**

## Project Status

AlgoLang is actively under development. So far, the word list and a basic version of the language generator are in place, along with the initial design for the LangMake graphical user interface (GUI). Future updates will include more parameters and enhanced generation algorithms. Community feedback and contributions are highly appreciated.

- **Latest updates:** New parameters have been added, and the GUI has been redesigned.

## Getting Started

To get started with AlgoLang:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Adrien141592653589793238462643383279502/AlgoLang.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

    ```bash
    cd AlgoLang
    ```

3. Ensure you have Python installed. To run the generator, execute:

    ```bash
    python LangMake.py
    ```

4. You can also explore the word list used by the generator, which is located in the project folder.

## How It Works

AlgoLang generates new words by applying predefined rules to an input list of French words. Here's a summary of the process:

- The generator creates new words using a Python-coded algorithm.
- Each generated word is paired with a corresponding French word.
- The result is saved to a file containing both the French words and their AlgoLang translations.

Future versions will enhance the algorithm with more sophisticated generation rules to improve the output quality.
