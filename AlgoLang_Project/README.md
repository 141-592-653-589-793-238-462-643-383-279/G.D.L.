# AlgoLang
## Description
AlgoLang is a language generated by a program provisionally named G.D.L. (Générateur De Langues = Languages Generator).

This language generator is coded in Python and, for the moment, uses three lists. A list of 174 adjectives, a list of 623 nouns and a list of 421 verbs. These lists can be accessed from the “[Project](https://github.com/Adrien141592653589793238462643383279502/G.D.L./tree/bd1b331a6f44e6b8e62a53a1cfc07738c3991e8c/Project)” file. All these words are among the most frequently used in French and are therefore in french language.

The program's operation is fairly straightforward. For each word, the program generates and assigns another word based on specific criteria defined upstream in the code, as automatically as possible.
## Project status
The project is currently under development. Only the [lists]([[https://github.com/Adrien141592653589793238462643383279502/G.D.L./tree/764f56fc5e64a3974eec633de7453ed03a0098c1/Project/Dictionaries](https://github.com/Adrien141592653589793238462643383279502/AlgoLang_Project/tree/d77fd86bc74e6041fbe774c66b9c79456c6b5f2e/AlgoLang_Project/Project))](https://github.com/Adrien141592653589793238462643383279502/AlgoLang_Project/tree/main/AlgoLang_Project/Project) have been created for the moment. We welcome any comments or advice you may have.
